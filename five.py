# Write a Python program that demonstrates how to import and use a function from another Python module. The program should:
# Define a function fun1() inside a module named module8 that prints "fun1 of module8".
# In the main program, modify the sys.path to include a specific directory, then import module8 from that directory.
# Call the fun1() function from module8 in the main program.

def fun1():
    print("fun 1 of module five.py")
